## Submission Details
- **Platform**: Moodle
- **Deadline**: 25th October, 11:59 PM

## Assignment Overview
This repository contains the materials for our third assignment in the Programming for Data Science course. Our task is to solve a series of coding exercises.

## Assignment Guidelines
Homework Assigment Three focus in the step-by-step implementation of a simple, yet popular, clustering algorithm, the K-Means. Although in most projects you will source algorithms from libraries such as scikit-learn or Keras, in other cases you will need to implement an algorithm yourself. For instance, if such algorithm is not available or if you want to tailor the algorithm to your problem. In that sense, learning to implement algorithms is an important part of your skillset.

This is an Individual assingment, students that are caught cheating will obtain a score of 0 points.<br>
The Homeworking Assignment Three is worth 10% of your final grade.

The submission package should correspond to a .zip archive (.rar files are not acceptable) with the following files:
1. Jupyter Notebook with the output of all the cells;
2. HTML print of your Jupyter Notebook;
3. All files outputed as part of the exercises.

The .zip archive filename should be student1ID_student2ID.

Your submission will be graded according to the following guidelines:
1. Execution (does your program does what is asked from the exercise?)
2. Objectivity (are you using the adequate libraries?)
3. Readibility of your code (that includes comments, naming of variables, supporting text, etc ...)

In some questions might require that you make critical decisions, or design choices. In such cases, you will be graded according also for your ability to justify and support your decisions.

**Comment your code properly, which includes naming your variables in a meaningful manner. Badly documented code will be penalized.**

Submission is done through the respective Moodle activity.
Deadline is November 2nd at 12:00. A penality of 1 point per day late will be applied to late deliveries, with a maximum of 5 days.
