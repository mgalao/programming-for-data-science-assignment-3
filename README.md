# Programming for Data Science: Assignment 3

## Team Members

- Marco Galão

## Submission Details
- **Platform**: Moodle
- **Deadline**: 25th October, 11:59 PM

## Assignment Overview
This repository contains the materials for our third assignment in the Programming for Data Science course. Our task is to solve a series of coding exercises.

## Assignment Guidelines
Your submission will be graded according to the following guidelines:
1. **Execution** (does your program do what is asked from the exercise?)
2. **Objectivity** (are you using the adequate imports?)
3. **Readability** of your code (including comments, variable naming, supporting text, etc ...)

Some questions might require that you make critical decisions or design choices. In such cases, you will be graded according to your ability to justify and support your decisions.

**Comment your code properly, which includes naming your variables in a meaningful manner. Badly documented code will be penalized.**

**Students that are caught cheating will obtain a score of 0 points.**

The submission package should correspond to a .zip archive (.rar files are not accepted) with the following files:
1. Jupyter Notebook with the output of all the cells;
2. HTML print of your Jupyter Notebook (in Jupyter go to File -> Download as -> HTML);

Please change the name of the notebook to "<student_1_id>_<student_2_id>.ipynb", replacing <student_id> by your student_id.
